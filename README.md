####Status of the Project
0.9.27 version of J!Track Gallery have been pushed in March 2017.  
Last months commits were mostly related to adding new feature and bug fix.

####History of J!TrackGallery  
J!TrackGallery may be considered as a fork of [InJooosm](http://injooosm.sourceforge.net/)
This valuable component is no longer maintained (last version is for Joomla 1.5). At the beginning of this project, I was not able to reach previous author so I decided to rename the component from InJooOSM to J!TrackGallery. 

It may be note that **InJooosm** was a fork of [joomgpstracks](http://www.joomlaos.de/Joomla_CMS_Downloads/Joomla_Komponenten/JoomGPSTracks.html)

 - Many Thanks to *Michael Pfister* (JoomGPSTracks) and *Christian Knorr* (InJooOSM) for providing this valuable component to the Open source community. 

N.B. For those who always use InJooosm 0.5.7, see manual: http://jtrackgallery.net/wiki/install/migrate-from-injoosm
