###J!TrackGallery

J!TrackGallery is a Joomla Track Gallery component.  
Our Goal is to provide a non commercial, free, open source, GNU/GPL2 licensed component for Joomla 2.5 and 3.x. 
Allowing to seamlessly upload GPX tracks and display maps on Joomla based website.

####Status of the Repro
0.7.5 version of J!Track Gallery have been pushed on February 2014. 
- this version is only working on Joomla 2.5 (not designed for Joomla version below 2.5) 
- install script has to be improved to account for update server

####Status of the Project
At present time, the component is working under J! 2.5. Some features have been tested. 
Backend is quite OK. Displaying Maps and charts is OK.

####History of J!TrackGallery  
J!TrackGallery may be considered as a fork of [InJooosm](http://injooosm.sourceforge.net/)
This valuable component is no longer maintained (last version is for Joomla 1.5) and the author is not reachable.  

It may be note that **InJooosm** was a fork of [joomgpstracks](http://www.joomlaos.de/Joomla_CMS_Downloads/Joomla_Komponenten/JoomGPSTracks.html)
More information (soon available) on [J!Track Gallery website](http://jtrackgallery.net/)
N.B. For those who always use InJooosm 0.5.7, we intend to provide a *migrate from injooosm to J!TrackGallery* feature in our component
