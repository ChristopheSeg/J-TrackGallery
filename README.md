###J!TrackGallery

J!TrackGallery is a Joomla Track Gallery component.  
Our Goal is to provide a non commercial, free, open source, GNU/GPL licensed component for Joomla 2.5 and 3.x. 
Allowing to seamlessly upload GPX tracks and display maps on Joomla based website.

####Status of the Repro
The present repro was set up on May 29th 2013.   
Please wait a while, we have a lot of stuff at present time!  
We will soon configure the repro, contacts, propose a website and wikis dedicated to this project (may be a forum ?).

####Status of the Project
At present time, the component is partly working under J! 2.5.9. Main features have been recoded. 
Backend is quite OK. Displaying Maps is OK but Charts need further works.  
J!Track Gallery will be published in the repro after significant work will be achieved (see [schedule](schedule)
####History of J!TrackGallery
J!TrackGallery may be considered as a fork of [InJooosm](http://injooosm.sourceforge.net/)
This valuable component is no longer maintained (last version is for Joomla 1.5) and the author are not reachable. 
It may be note that **InJooosm** was a fork of [joomgpstracks](http://www.joomlaos.de/Joomla_CMS_Downloads/Joomla_Komponenten/JoomGPSTracks.html)

N.B. For those who always use InJooosm 0.5.7, we will provide a *migrate from injooosm to J!TrackGallery* feature in our component
