###J!TrackGallery

J!TrackGallery is a Joomla Track Gallery component.  
Our Goal is to provide a non commercial, free, open source, GNU/GPL2 licensed component for Joomla 2.5 and 3.x. 
Allowing to seamlessly upload GPX tracks and display maps on Joomla based website.

####Status of the Project
0.7.5 version of J!Track Gallery have been pushed on February 2014.  
At present time, the component is working under J! 2.5. Most important features have been tested. 
Backend is quite OK. Displaying Maps and charts is OK.  

- in February 2014: we started to work at J!3.x compatibility

####History of J!TrackGallery  
J!TrackGallery may be considered as a fork of [InJooosm](http://injooosm.sourceforge.net/)
This valuable component is no longer maintained (last version is for Joomla 1.5). At the beginning of this project, I was not able to reach previous author so I decided to rename the component friom InJooOSM to J!TrackGallery. 

It may be note that **InJooosm** was a fork of [joomgpstracks](http://www.joomlaos.de/Joomla_CMS_Downloads/Joomla_Komponenten/JoomGPSTracks.html)
More information (soon available) on [J!Track Gallery website](http://jtrackgallery.net/)

 - Many Thanks to *Michael Pfister* (JoomGPSTracks) and *Christian Knorr* (InJooOSM) for providing this valuable component to the Open source community. 

N.B. For those who always use InJooosm 0.5.7, we intend to provide a *migrate from injooosm to J!TrackGallery* feature in our component
