###J!TrackGallery

J!TrackGallery is a Joomla Track Gallery component.  
Our Goal is to provide a non commercial, free, open source, GNU/GPL2 licensed component for Joomla 2.5 and 3.x. 
Allowing to seamlessly upload GPX tracks and display maps on Joomla based website.

####Status of the Repro
0.6.2 version of J!Track Gallery (0.6.0) have been pushed on August 27 2013. 
- this version is only working on Joomla 2.5 (not designed for Joomla version below 2.5) 
- install script is minimalist and has to be improved and redesigned

####Status of the Project
At present time, the component is partly working under J! 2.5.9. Main features have been recoded, but many features have to be tested. 
Backend is quite OK. Displaying Maps and charts is OK.  
J!Track Gallery will be published in the repro after significant work will be achieved : see [project schedule](https://github.com/ChristopheSeg/J-TrackGallery/wiki/project-schedule)
####History of J!TrackGallery  
J!TrackGallery may be considered as a fork of [InJooosm](http://injooosm.sourceforge.net/)
This valuable component is no longer maintained (last version is for Joomla 1.5) and the author is not reachable.  

It may be note that **InJooosm** was a fork of [joomgpstracks](http://www.joomlaos.de/Joomla_CMS_Downloads/Joomla_Komponenten/JoomGPSTracks.html)
More information (soon available) on [J!Track Gallery website](http://jtrackgallery.net/)
N.B. For those who always use InJooosm 0.5.7, we intend to provide a *migrate from injooosm to J!TrackGallery* feature in our component
