###J!TrackGallery

J!TrackGallery is a Joomla Track Gallery component.  
Our Goal is to provide a non commercial, free, open source, GNU/GPL2 licensed component for Joomla 2.5 and 3.x.

####Status of the Project
0.9.6 version of J!Track Gallery have been pushed January 2015.  
Most frontend and backend features have been tested under J! 2.5 and J3.x

####History of J!TrackGallery  
J!TrackGallery may be considered as a fork of [InJooosm](http://injooosm.sourceforge.net/)
This valuable component is no longer maintained (last version is for Joomla 1.5). At the beginning of this project, I was not able to reach previous author so I decided to rename the component friom InJooOSM to J!TrackGallery. 

It may be note that **InJooosm** was a fork of [joomgpstracks](http://www.joomlaos.de/Joomla_CMS_Downloads/Joomla_Komponenten/JoomGPSTracks.html)
More information (soon available) on [J!Track Gallery website](http://jtrackgallery.net/)

 - Many Thanks to *Michael Pfister* (JoomGPSTracks) and *Christian Knorr* (InJooOSM) for providing this valuable component to the Open source community. 

N.B. For those who always use InJooosm 0.5.7, see manual: http://jtrackgallery.net/wiki/install/migrate-from-injoosm
