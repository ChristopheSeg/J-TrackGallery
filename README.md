###J!TrackGallery

J!TrackGallery is a Joomla Track Gallery component.  
Our Goal is to provide a non commercial, free, open source, GNU/GPL2 licensed component for Joomla 2.5 and 3.x. 
Allowing to seamlessly upload GPX tracks and display maps on Joomla based website.

####Status of the Repro
First version of J!Track Gallery (0.6.0) have been pushed on June 19 2013. 
- this version is only working on Joomla 2.5 (tested with 2.5.9) 
- install script is minimalist and has to be improved
- charts displaying has not been rewritten and is no longer working

####Status of the Project
At present time, the component is partly working under J! 2.5.9. Main features have been recoded. 
Backend is quite OK. Displaying Maps is OK but Charts need further works.  
J!Track Gallery will be published in the repro after significant work will be achieved : see [project schedule](https://github.com/ChristopheSeg/J-TrackGallery/wiki/project-schedule)
####History of J!TrackGallery
J!TrackGallery may be considered as a fork of [InJooosm](http://injooosm.sourceforge.net/)
This valuable component is no longer maintained (last version is for Joomla 1.5) and the author are not reachable. 
It may be note that **InJooosm** was a fork of [joomgpstracks](http://www.joomlaos.de/Joomla_CMS_Downloads/Joomla_Komponenten/JoomGPSTracks.html)
More information (soon available) on [J!Track Gallery website](http://jtrackgallery.net/)
N.B. For those who always use InJooosm 0.5.7, we will provide a *migrate from injooosm to J!TrackGallery* feature in our component
